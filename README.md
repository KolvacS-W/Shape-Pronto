Conducted a user study to extract the design space of Shape Pronto made by Reality Composer
We picked a creative design task I am interested in: shape-based art effects mixing art elements with physical objects. We proposed Shape Prontoâ€”AR effect prototypes that suit the shape of real objects and conducted a user study to extract the design space, illustrating one way that AR can help produce this creative inspiration and boost artistic imagination.
